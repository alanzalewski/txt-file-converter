# txt-file-converter
### Script and instructions for converting a FluxMed .txt file to either .csv or .xlsx format.

The script can be launched command line with the following prompt (the working directory must be the same as the director the script is located in though):
```sh
python convertfiles.py
```
The user can choose to convert the .txt files to either .csv or .xlsx, and can then select multiple files to convert.
Note: the original .txt files will remain in the same directory as the output .csv/.xlsx files unless manually deleted.
